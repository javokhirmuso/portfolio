			"In this project, I developed a robust solution for segmenting microscopy images using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging the YOLOv11n-seg model, I trained the system on a dataset sourced from Roboflow Universe, which includes classes such as 'blood_vessel', 'glomerulus', and 'unsure'. The model was trained over 500 epochs with a batch size of 64 and an image size of 640 pixels, resulting in a tool capable of accurately identifying and segmenting cellular structures in microscopy images. This work aims to assist researchers in analyzing complex biological data more efficiently.",
